# Game of Life - GIF

### Prelude

Hello everyone,

we decided to make your coding of Assignment 4 a little bit more fun as well as give you an option to earn some extra marks. Your task is going to be simple - make a GIF out of the iterations from your Game of Life class.

### Context

[John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway), the creator of the Game of Life is one of the most respected mathematicians currently alive. He is also known for his Conway Notation, Surreal Numbers, Free Will Theorem and many other attributions.

### Your Task
Since the Game of Life is a zero-player game ( meaning the evolution is determined by its initial state ), people have discovered interesting states that produce fascinating output. Here is an example of what is known as *Gospers glider Gun*.
