# Game of Life - GIF

### Prelude

Hello everyone,

we decided to make your coding of Assignment 4 a little bit more fun as well as give you an option to earn some extra marks. Your task is going to be simple - make a GIF out of the iterations from your Game of Life class.

### Context

[John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway), the creator of the Game of Life is one of the most respected mathematicians currently alive. He is also known for his Conway Notation, Surreal Numbers, Free Will Theorem and many other attributions.

### Your Task
Since the Game of Life is a zero-player game ( meaning the evolution is determined by its initial state ), people have discovered interesting states that produce fascinating output. Here is an example of what is known as *Gospers glider Gun*.

Your task is to create 2 GIFs by taking screenshots of each evolution and then by using any tool you want ( such as [gifmaker.me](https://gifmaker.me) ) create the GIF files. 

This is my take on pentadec with 15 iterations ( the 15th iteration is the same as the first one ):
